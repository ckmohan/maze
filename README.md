Maze Test
---------


We recognize that you may have questions about these requirements. For the purpose of this test, please make an assumption about the answer and note your assumptions in a readme.txt submitted with your solution. You should be ready to explain any assumptions and technical choices you have made during later interview stages.

There is no stated time limit but allow at least half a day. The important thing is to arrive at a solution that you are satisfied with and comfortable discussing with others.

The code must be representative of what you would produce “on the job”, by that we mean it must be clear, maintainable bug free and efficient.

The zipped project is for intellij and uses maven; you should feel free to use any other tools you are more comfortable with.  There are 2 classes in it and you should feel free to change these in any way you see fit, including deleting them and starting again.

The test is based on exploring any arbitrary maze (one is provided).
